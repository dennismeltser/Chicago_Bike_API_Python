# Chicago_Bike_API_Python
A project done for my graduate program python course to connect to a Chicago API for their downtown bike rentals. This was used to manipulate the data, connect to MongoDB and upload/pull the data from a collection and use sqlite and pandas to run some analysis on the data.
